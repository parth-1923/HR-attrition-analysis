# HR-attrition-analysis
The HR Attrition Analysis project identified key factors driving employee turnover using Power BI. Data was cleaned and transformed with Power Query, followed by EDA to extract insights. An interactive dashboard with KPIs and slicers visualized attrition trends to support data-driven HR decisions.

#### Insights:
- Key Metrics: 
- Total Employees: 1,470
- Attrition Count: 237
- Attrition Rate: 16.12%
- Average Salary: $6.5K
- Average Age: 36.92 years

- **This page paints the broad picture: a mid-career, male-majority workforce, with attrition concentrated in R&D and Sales among employees aged 26–35. Salary and age distribution are normal, but turnover seems tied to career mobility and departmental stress.**

#### Insights:
- Key Metrics: 
- Overtime Employees: 416
- Environment Satisfaction Avg: 2.72
- Job Satisfaction Avg: 2.73
- Work-Life Balance Avg: 2.76

- **This page reveals that overtime, mediocre work-life balance, and average satisfaction levels are major contributors to attrition.
Employees generally get along well but feel neutral about their jobs and environment — indicating a need for better engagement programs, flexibility, and growth opportunities.**

#### Overall Insights:
**Across both pages, attrition is driven by:**
- **Mid-career employees (26–35)**
- **R&D and Sales departments**
- **Overtime workload and average job satisfaction**
- **Moderate work-life balance**
  
- **Reducing overtime, improving recognition and role satisfaction, and providing career growth paths could help significantly lower the attrition rate.**
